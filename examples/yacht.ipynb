We'll then standardise the data such that is distributed according to a unit normal distribution.

R2 measures the amount of variation within the data that is explained by the model. This can be useful when designing variance reduction methods such as control variates as it allows you to understand what proportion of the data's variance will be soaked up. A perfect model here would score 1 for R2 score, whereas predicting the data's mean would score 0 and models doing worse than simple mean predictions can score less than 0."
