    "# Gaussian Processes Barycentres\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we'll give an implementation of <strong data-cite=\"mallasto2017learning\"></strong>. In this work, the existence of a Wasserstein barycentre between a collection of Gaussian processes is proven. When faced with trying to _average_ a set of probability distributions, the Wasserstein barycentre is an attractive choice as it enables uncertainty amongst the individual distributions to be incorporated into the averaged distribution. When compared to a naive _mean of means_ and _mean of variances_ approach to computing the average probability distributions, it can be seen that Wasserstein barycentres offer significantly more favourable uncertainty estimation."

    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "### Wasserstein distance\n",
    "\n",
    "The 2-Wasserstein distance metric between two probability measures $\\mu$ and $\\nu$ quantifies the minimal cost required to transport the unit mass from $\\mu$ to $\\nu$, or vice-versa. Typically, computing this metric requires solving a linear program. However, when $\\mu$ and $\\nu$ both belong to the family of multivariate Gaussian distributions, the solution is analytically given by\n",
    "$$W_2^2(\\mu, \\nu) = \\lVert m_1- m_2 \\rVert^2_2 + \\operatorname{Tr}(S_1 + S_2 - 2(S_1^{1/2}S_2S_1^{1/2})^{1/2}),$$\n",
    "where $\\mu \\sim \\mathcal{N}(m_1, S_1)$ and $\\nu\\sim\\mathcal{N}(m_2, S_2)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Wasserstein barycentre\n",
    "\n",
    "For a collection of $T$ measures $\\lbrace\\mu_i\\rbrace_{t=1}^T \\in \\mathcal{P}_2(\\theta)$, the Wasserstein barycentre $\\bar{\\mu}$ is the measure that minimises the average Wasserstein distance to all other measures in the set. More formally, the Wasserstein barycentre is the Fr√©chet mean on a Wasserstein space that we can write as\n",
    "$$\\bar{\\mu} = \\operatorname{argmin}_{\\mu\\in\\mathcal{P}_2(\\theta)}\\sum_{t=1}^T \\alpha_t W_2^2(\\mu, \\mu_t),$$\n",
    "where $\\alpha\\in\\bbR^T$ is a weight vector that sums to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with the Wasserstein distance, identifying the Wasserstein barycentre $\\bar{\\mu}$ is often an computationally demanding optimisation problem. However, when all the measures admit a multivariate Gaussian density, the barycentre $\\bar{\\mu} = \\mathcal{N}(\\bar{m}, \\bar{S})$ has analytical solutions\n",
    "$$\\bar{m} = \\sum_{t=1}^T \\alpha_t m_t\\,, \\quad \\bar{S}=\\sum_{t=1}^T\\alpha_t (\\bar{S}^{1/2}S_t\\bar{S}^{1/2})^{1/2}\\,. \\qquad (\\star)$$\n",
    "Identifying $\\bar{S}$ is achieved through a fixed-point iterative update.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Barycentre of Gaussian processes\n",
    "\n",
    "It was shown in <strong data-cite=\"mallasto2017learning\"></strong> that the barycentre $\\bar{f}$ of a collection of Gaussian processes $\\lbrace f_i\\rbrace_{i=1}^T$ such that $f_i \\sim \\mathcal{GP}(m_i, K_i)$ can be found using the same solutions as in $(\\star)$. For a full theoretical understanding, we recommend reading the original paper. However, the central argument to this result is that one can first show that the barycentre GP $\\bar{f}\\sim\\mathcal{GP}(\\bar{m}, \\bar{S})$ is non-degenerate for any finite set of GPs $\\lbrace f_t\\rbrace_{t=1}^T$ i.e., $T<\\infty$. With this established, one can show that for a $n$-dimensional finite Gaussian distribution $f_{i,n}$, the Wasserstein metric between any two Gaussian distributions $f_{i, n}, f_{j, n}$ converges to the Wasserstein metric between GPs as $n\\to\\infty$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will demonstrate how this can be achieved in GPJax.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll simulate five datasets and develop a Gaussian process posterior before identifying the Gaussian process barycentre at a set of test points. Each dataset will be a sine function with a different vertical shift, periodicity, and quantity of noise."
