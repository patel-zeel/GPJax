    "# Sparse Stochastic Variational Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we demonstrate how to implement sparse variational Gaussian processes (SVGPs) of <strong data-cite=\"hensman2013gaussian\">Hensman et al. (2013)</strong>; <strong data-cite=\"hensman2015gaussian\">Hensman et al. (2015)</strong>. In particular, this approximation framework provides a tractable option for working with non-conjugate Gaussian processes with more than ~5000 data points. However, for conjugate models of less than 5000 data points, we recommend using the marginal log-likelihood approach presented in the [regression notebook](https://gpjax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nbs/regression.html). Though we illustrate SVGPs here with a conjugate regression example, the same GPJax code works for general likelihoods, such as a Bernoulli for classification."

    "\n",
    "Despite their endowment with elegant theoretical properties, GPs are burdened with prohibitive $\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ inference and $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ memory costs in the number of data points $n$ due to the necessity of computing inverses and determinants of the kernel Gram matrix $\\mathbf{K}_{\\boldsymbol{x}\\boldsymbol{x}}$ during inference and hyperparameter learning. \n",
    "Sparse GPs seek to resolve tractability through low-rank approximations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Their name originates with the idea of using subsets of the data to approximate the kernel matrix, with _sparseness_ occurring through the selection of the data points. \n",
    "Given inputs $\\boldsymbol{x}$ and outputs $\\boldsymbol{y}$ the task was to select an $m<n$ lower-dimensional dataset $(\\boldsymbol{z},\\boldsymbol{\\tilde{y}}) \\subset (\\boldsymbol{x}, \\boldsymbol{y})$ to train a Gaussian process on instead. \n",
    "By generalising the set of selected points $\\boldsymbol{z}$, known as _inducing inputs_, to remove the restriction of being part of the dataset, \n",
    "we can arrive at a flexible low-rank approximation framework of the model using functions of $\\mathbf{K}_{\\boldsymbol{z}\\boldsymbol{z}}$ to replace the true covariance matrix $\\mathbf{K}_{\\boldsymbol{x}\\boldsymbol{x}}$ at significantly lower costs. For example, <strong data-cite=\"quinonero-candela2005gaussian\"></strong> review many popular approximation schemes in this vein. However, because the model and the approximation are intertwined, assigning performance and faults to one or the other becomes tricky. \n",

By parametrising $q(f(\\boldsymbol{z}))$ over a variational family of distributions, we can optimise Kullback-Leibler divergence with respect to the variational parameters. Moreover, since inducing input locations $\\boldsymbol{z}$ augment the model, they themselves can be treated as variational parameters without altering the true underlying model $p(f(\\boldsymbol{z})|\\mathcal{D})$. This is exactly what gives SVGPs great flexibility whilst retaining robustness to overfitting. \n",
